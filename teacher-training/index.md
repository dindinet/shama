&nbsp; &nbsp;2019 : A comprehensive (yoga alliance 200 hrs ) transformational training programme covering all aspects of Yoga practice, theory and teaching.</div>
The purpose of the course is to provide students with a solid grounding in traditional Yoga and yoga teaching for contemporary times. We emphasise an eclectic, non-dogmatic experiential approach, which includes assisting in classes, supervised teaching and personalised mentoring. Students are encouraged to explore their own creativity and evolve their own wonderfully individualistic teaching style.<br />
Graduates of our training programme have gone on to share yoga with others in health care centres, universities, gyms, adult education centres, schools and care homes for the elderly and people with disabilities, as well as in private classes for groups and individuals.<br />
<h3>
The course consists of six main themes of study:</h3>
<ol>
<li>asana</li>
<li>pranayama</li>
<li>meditation</li>
<li>teaching</li>
<li>philosophy</li>
<li>anatomy and physiology</li>
</ol>

<br />

Our programme is open to all students who are sincere and passionate in their yoga practice and wish to become teachers of yoga: existing teachers of yoga, within varying styles and traditions, who wish to deepen their knowledge and skills; and students of yoga who, without necessarily wanting to become yoga teachers, wish for a greater experience and knowledge of yoga.<br />
<h3>
Course Commitments</h3>
Twelve months, one weekend a month (including some working lunches) plus 2 hours a month (on average) guided home study (reading and written assignments).<br />
There will be 6 ongoing assessed teaching practice sessions taking place, where trainees will be offering assistance during bi-monthly yoga days, which are open to the general public.<br />

<br />

There will also be one major teaching assessment towards the end of the course, the actual date of which may be specified by the student.<br />
Each weekend will open and close with a sharing circle to summarise the main topics of the weekend.
